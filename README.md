# AI Captcha

A parody of a typical reCAPTCHA that uses both normal drawn art and generated AI art. 

## What's it made with?

Initalized with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) (tRPC, TailwindCSS, and Typescript) along with Prisma and Next.js.

The infrastructure this uses is a combination of Vercel for hosting the website and backend, Planetscale for the DB, and AWS S3 for the images.
